# GitMate User Intents
# Git command names that the AI should detect from natural language
# Each intent represents a Git command that can be executed with context-aware parameters

intents:
  - commit    # User wants to save changes (e.g., "commit my changes", "save my work")
  - push      # User wants to upload to remote (e.g., "push to remote", "upload changes")
  - init      # User wants to start a repository (e.g., "initialize repo", "start git repo")
  - status    # User wants to see current state (e.g., "show status", "what's changed")
  - branch    # User wants to work with branches (e.g., "create branch", "new feature branch")
  - add       # User wants to stage files (e.g., "add files", "stage changes")
  - log       # User wants to see history (e.g., "show history", "commit log")
  - switch    # User wants to switch context (e.g., "switch branch", "go to main")
  - pull      # User wants to get remote changes (e.g., "pull changes", "get latest")
  - remote    # User wants to see remote info (e.g., "show remotes", "list remotes")
  - N/A       # User input is irrelevant to Git operations (e.g., "what's the weather", "hello")
